11/13:

What have we done:
-We have created the database, and inserted some hats. 
-We have finished our login and registration pages. 
-We have started work on testing


What we are planning for this next week:
-We want to get our hat shopping page finished
-get cart page finished
-We want to get our unit tests finished
-We want to finish our UAT document
-Adding items, cart, etc. to header files

What challenges we are facing:
-Our unit testing is still not working correctly

Unit Testing:
- Login Success redirects to hats page (positive)
- login failure redirects to register (negative)
- register success redirects to profile (positive)
- register fail sends error message (negative)
